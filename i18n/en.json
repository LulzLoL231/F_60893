My name is Pump Father, which means that not a single pump escapes me {coolface}\n\nI provide access to the monitoring system for the accounts of famous personalities, exchanges, etc., who, to one degree or another, have a significant impact on the cryptocurrency market. With my help, you will be able to enter all pumps in the first seconds of their appearance.\n\nI will tell you the algorithm of my work, just click on the \"{magic} Start\" button below.",
    "begin": "Okay, let's continue. As mentioned earlier, our system monitors some Internet resources that are sources of pumps. Let me give you a simple example! You all know Elon Musk and his involvement in a crypto-meme called Dogecoin. Any of his tweets on the topic of this crypto-asset causes a storm of emotions among coin holders, and most importantly, a good jump in price up to 202784534697% (just kidding)",
    "begin1": "Actually, what is our bot doing? The bot works clearly according to the following chain: Tweet - tweet recognition - opening a deal on the exchange - notifying the user about the pump. There are a few seconds between a tweet and a trade opening. As a result, we manage to fly into the pump among the first lucky ones and take a bunch of profit on his highs {moneyface}",
    "begin2": "The most important thing. You can easily join our guild of pump hunters and our system will automatically open deals on your account, you can do this by paying for a bot subscription. In order to learn more about the terms of subscription, just click on the \"Subscribe\" button below.",

    "faq": "F.A.Q.\n\n<b>What do I need to start hunting?</b>\nBinance futures account and initial deposit\n\n<b>Do I need to follow the news, log into the bot, check the rate?</b>\nYou don't need anything, you go about your business when necessary, the bot will send notifications\n<b>How much does a subscription cost?</b>\n290$ per month\n<b>What exchange will trades be made on?</b>\nBinance\n\n<b>How will a bot open a trade on my account?</b>\nYou will need to provide your API keys to make deals.\n\n<b>Can a bot close a deal by itself?</b>\nWe are working in this direction, but so far we can offer functions in the form of placing stops and trailing orders.\n\n<b>Do I need to provide personal information about my account?</b>\nNo\n\n<b>Can I enter with 50x leverage?</b>\nNo, you have to take risks.\n\n<b>What if you withdraw money and steal my account?</b>\nThis is impossible, the withdrawal of funds through the API is limited by default, especially since 2fa will not allow us to do this.\n\n<b>Do I need to be ready for a pump?</b>\nYes. The pump can happen at any time of the day, so you should always be able to go to the exchange and close the deal.\n\n<b>How will the bot send me notifications?</b>\nThe bot will send 15 notifications every 2 seconds, in the chat from which you paid for the subscription.\n\n<b>Will you be in touch at the time of the pump?</b>\nYes, we conduct an online analysis of each pump in our tg channel https://t.me/pumps_hunter\n\n<b>Could it be that the deal did not open?</b>\nYes, very rarely, but unfortunately this is possible. Exchange systems sometimes lag and a request to open a trade may not be fulfilled for technical reasons. Alas, if you have not opened a deal, this pump is lost for you.",
